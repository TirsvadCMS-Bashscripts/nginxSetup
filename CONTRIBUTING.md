# How to contribute
I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project continue to be up to date

## Submitting changes
Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to TirsvadCMS](https://github.com/TirsvadCMS-Bashscripts/nginx_setup/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done
Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are one feature per commit.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
